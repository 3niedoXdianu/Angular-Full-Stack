However, playing Madou Monogatari on PC-98 is not as simple as downloading a ROM and running it on your emulator. You will also need a specific BIOS file that matches the version of the game you want to play. In this article, we will show you how to find and install the BIOS 17 file that is compatible with most of the Madou Monogatari games for PC-98.
 
## What is BIOS 17 and Why Do You Need It?
 
BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System, and it is a firmware that controls the basic functions of a computer system. The PC-98 has several versions of BIOS files that correspond to different models and hardware configurations. Some games require a specific BIOS file to run properly, while others can run on any BIOS file.
 
Madou Monogatari is one of those games that need a specific BIOS file to work. Most of the Madou Monogatari games for PC-98 require the BIOS 17 file, which is also known as N88.ROM or N88.BIN. This file contains the necessary code and data to run the game's graphics, sound, and input.
 
If you try to run Madou Monogatari on PC-98 without the BIOS 17 file, you will encounter various errors and glitches, such as missing sprites, distorted music, or frozen screens. Therefore, you need to download and install the BIOS 17 file on your emulator before playing Madou Monogatari.
 
## Where to Find and Download BIOS 17?
 
The BIOS 17 file is not easy to find online, as it is considered a copyrighted material that belongs to NEC Corporation, the manufacturer of the PC-98. However, there are some websites that host the file for educational purposes only. We do not condone or encourage piracy or illegal distribution of software.
 
One of the websites that offer the BIOS 17 file is [Old-Games.ru](https://www.old-games.ru/wiki/PC-9801), which is a Russian website that specializes in retro gaming. You can find the BIOS 17 file under the "BIOS" section of their PC-9801 page. The file name is "N88.BIN", and it has a size of 32 KB.
