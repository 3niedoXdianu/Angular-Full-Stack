## What are SHX Fonts?
 
SHX fonts are vector-based fonts that are composed of lines and arcs. They are stored in files with the .shx extension and can be loaded into AutoCAD using the STYLE or FONTALT commands. SHX fonts have some advantages over TrueType fonts (TTF), such as:
 
- They are more compatible with AutoCAD and other CAD software.
- They can be scaled without losing quality or clarity.
- They can be edited and customized using the SHAPE or EXPLODE commands.
- They can be embedded into DWG files without requiring external files.

However, SHX fonts also have some limitations, such as:

- They have fewer characters and symbols than TTF fonts.
- They may not support Unicode or international characters.
- They may not display correctly in some applications or devices.
