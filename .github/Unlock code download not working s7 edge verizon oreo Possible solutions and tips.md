## What causes the unlock code download issue?
 
The unlock code download issue is caused by a security feature called FRP (Factory Reset Protection) that prevents unauthorized access to your device after a factory reset. FRP requires you to enter your Google account credentials to verify your identity and unlock your device. However, if you flash a custom firmware or root your device, FRP might not recognize your Google account and block the unlock code download process.
 
## How to fix the unlock code download issue?
 
There are two possible ways to fix the unlock code download issue on your Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Verizon Oreo:
 
1. Use Odin and TWRP to flash a stock Oreo firmware and bypass FRP. This method requires a computer and a USB cable. You can follow the steps below:
    - Download Odin 3.12.7 and the TWRP images for your phone from [^4^] and [^5^] respectively.
    - Download the stock Oreo firmware for your phone from [^3^]. Make sure it matches your model number (G935V).
    - Extract the firmware file and you will get four files: AP, BL, CP, and CSC.
    - Open Odin on your computer and connect your phone to it in download mode. To enter download mode, power off your phone and press and hold Volume Down + Home + Power buttons until you see a warning screen. Then press Volume Up to continue.
    - In Odin, click on AP and select the AP file from the firmware folder. Do the same for BL, CP, and CSC.
    - Make sure that only Auto Reboot and F. Reset Time are checked in Odin options. Do not check Re-Partition or Nand Erase.
    - Click on Start and wait for Odin to flash the firmware. Your phone will reboot automatically when it's done.
    - After the reboot, you will see a screen asking you to enter your Google account credentials. Do not enter anything and power off your phone again.
    - Press and hold Volume Up + Home + Power buttons to enter recovery mode. You will see a blue screen with an Android logo.
    - Connect your phone to your computer again and copy the TWRP image file to your phone's internal storage.
    - In recovery mode, select Install update from ADB option and confirm with Power button.
    - On your computer, open a command prompt window and type adb sideload followed by the name of the TWRP image file. For example: adb sideload twrp-3.2.1-0-hero2lte.img
    - Wait for the sideload process to finish and then reboot your phone.
    - Your phone will boot into TWRP recovery mode. Swipe to allow modifications.
    - In TWRP, go to Wipe > Format Data and type yes to erase all data on your phone.
    - Go back to the main menu and select Reboot > System.
    - Your phone will boot into stock Oreo firmware without FRP lock. You can now use any SIM card on your phone.
2. Use an online service to get an unlock code for your phone. This method does not require a computer or a USB cable, but it might cost you some money depending on the service provider. You can follow the steps below:
    - Find an online service that offers unlock codes for Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Verizon Oreo. You can search on Google or use one of these websites: [^1^] or [^2^]. Make sure they have positive reviews and feedback from previous customers.
    - Enter your phone's IMEI number on the website. You can find it by dialing \*
