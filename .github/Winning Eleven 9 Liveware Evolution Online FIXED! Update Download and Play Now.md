## Step 2: Apply Trapcode Sound Keys to Your Audio Layer
 
To use Trapcode Sound Keys, you need to have an audio layer in your After Effects project. You can import any audio file that you want to use as a source for your motion graphics. Once you have your audio layer in your timeline, you need to apply Trapcode Sound Keys to it. To do this, go to Effect > Red Giant > Trapcode > Sound Keys. This will open up the effect panel for Trapcode Sound Keys.
 
## Step 3: Select Parts of Your Audio Spectrum and Generate Keyframes
 
The main feature of Trapcode Sound Keys is that it allows you to select parts of your audio spectrum and convert them into keyframes. You can do this by using the Range Selector tool in the effect panel. The Range Selector lets you choose a specific frequency range and amplitude range of your audio that you want to use as a trigger for your animation. You can adjust the range by dragging the handles on the spectrum graph or by entering numerical values in the boxes below. You can also change the color of the range selector for easier identification.
 
Once you have selected a range, you need to click on the Apply button at the bottom of the effect panel. This will generate keyframes on your audio layer based on the selected range. You can see these keyframes in your timeline as small dots on your audio layer. You can also view them in the Graph Editor by pressing F3 on your keyboard.
 
## Step 4: Link Your Keyframes to Your Animation Properties
 
The final step is to link your keyframes to your animation properties. You can do this by using expressions or pickwhips in After Effects. Expressions are snippets of code that link one property to another property based on a mathematical formula. Pickwhips are visual tools that let you drag and drop one property onto another property to create a link between them.
 
To use expressions, you need to alt-click on the stopwatch icon of any property that you want to link to your keyframes. This will open up an expression field where you can type or paste an expression. To link a property to your keyframes, you need to use this expression:
 `temp = thisComp.layer("Audio Layer").effect("Sound Keys")("Output X");

[temp,temp,temp];` 
This expression will
