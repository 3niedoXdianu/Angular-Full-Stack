Garbage Day is a game that lets you do whatever you want in an open world sandbox. You can explore, interact, destroy, and create anything you can imagine. But be careful, because your actions have consequences. And sometimes, those consequences can be hilarious and painful.
 
One of the most popular features of Garbage Day is the ragdoll physics. When you get hit by a car, fall from a building, or explode a gas station, your body will flop around like a ragdoll. And sometimes, you can hear the sound of your bones cracking. Ouch!

Some players find this feature amusing and try to crack as many ribs as possible. They even share their screenshots and videos online, showing off their injuries and laughing at their misfortune.
