One of the main problems with FIFA 2002 is that it runs at a fixed resolution of 640x480, which is too low for today's monitors. To fix this, you need to download and install a program called nGlide, which is a wrapper that allows you to run old games that use the Glide API on modern graphics cards. You can download nGlide from here: [http://www.zeus-software.com/downloads/nglide](http://www.zeus-software.com/downloads/nglide). After installing nGlide, you need to configure it to run FIFA 2002 at your desired resolution and aspect ratio. You can do this by launching the nGlide configurator from the Start menu and selecting FIFA 2002 from the list of games. Then, you can adjust the settings according to your preference.
 
Another issue with FIFA 2002 is that it may not run properly on Windows 10 or other newer operating systems. To solve this, you need to download and replace the original fifa2002.exe file with a patched one that fixes some compatibility issues. You can download the patched fifa2002.exe file from here: [http://www.zeus-software.com/files/nglide/fifa2002\_patch.zip](http://www.zeus-software.com/files/nglide/fifa2002_patch.zip). After downloading the file, you need to extract it and copy it to the folder where you installed FIFA 2002, overwriting the original file.
