The novel is set in a village called Mooduru, where Mookajji, an 80-year-old widow, lives with her grandson Subbraya. Mookajji has a supernatural power of seeing the past and future in her dreams. She also has a deep insight into the origin and meaning of various traditions and superstitions that people follow blindly. Subbraya, who is curious and rational, often seeks Mookajji's guidance and wisdom on various matters. He finds her stories more interesting and realistic than the novels he reads.
