The book consists of three parts: The Adversarial Doctrine, The Adversarial Magick, and The Adversarial Rites. The first part outlines the core principles and ethics of Luciferianism, such as self-deification, individualism, antinomianism, rebellion, wisdom, and balance. It also explores the history and mythology of Lucifer and his allies, such as Lilith, Samael, Azazel, Ahriman, Set, Typhon, and Cain. The second part provides a detailed guide to Luciferian magick, including the theory and practice of invocation, evocation, sigils, talismans, astral projection, dream work, vampirism, lycanthropy, necromancy, and more. The third part contains a collection of rituals and ceremonies for various purposes, such as initiation, consecration, empowerment, protection, transformation, and apotheosis.
 
The Bible of the Adversary is a valuable resource for anyone interested in exploring the dark side of spirituality and developing their own path as a Luciferian. It is written in a clear and accessible style, with plenty of references and illustrations. It is not a book for beginners or the faint-hearted, however, as it challenges many conventional beliefs and morals and requires a high degree of commitment and responsibility from the practitioner.

Some quotes from the book that illustrate its main themes and messages are:
 
- "Luciferianism is a philosophy of self-deification and self-empowerment. It is a path of self-initiation and self-transformation. It is a path of becoming like Lucifer, the Light Bearer and the Adversary." (p. 13)
- "Luciferianism is not a religion, but a way of life. It is not a dogma, but a personal gnosis. It is not a doctrine, but a practice. It is not a faith, but a knowledge. It is not a belief, but a reality." (p. 14)
- "Luciferianism is based on the principle of antinomianism, which means 'against the law'. Antinomianism is the rejection of all external authority and moral codes imposed by society, religion, or any other source. Antinomianism is the affirmation of one's own will and individuality as the supreme law and value." (p. 15)
- "Luciferianism is based on the principle of rebellion, which means 'to rise again'. Rebellion is the act of challenging and overcoming the limitations and obstacles that prevent one from achieving one's goals and desires. Rebellion is the act of creating and manifesting one's own reality according to one's own vision and will." (p. 16)
- "Luciferianism is based on the principle of wisdom, which means 'to see'. Wisdom is the ability to perceive and understand the true nature of oneself and the world. Wisdom is the ability to discern and apply the knowledge and skills that are necessary for one's growth and development. Wisdom is the ability to learn from one's experiences and mistakes." (p. 17)
- "Luciferianism is based on the principle of balance, which means 'to harmonize'. Balance is the state of equilibrium and harmony between the opposing forces and aspects of oneself and the world. Balance is the state of being in tune with oneself and one's environment. Balance is the state of being in control of oneself and one's destiny." (p. 18)
